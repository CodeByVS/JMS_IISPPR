    title: "Bridging Literacy Gaps in India: Policy Solutions for Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal Using the Kerala Model",
    author: "Aindri Sur, Dhairya Maggo, A K Amalnath and Anuj Kumar",
    authorAbbrev:"A. Sur, D. Maggo, and others",
    abstract:"This research paper investigates the persistent literacy disparities in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal—three of India’s least literate states—and examines why national and state-level education policies have failed to bridge the gap. Using Kerala’s literacy model as a benchmark, the study identifies systemic barriers such as teacher shortages, poor school infrastructure, and socio-cultural inequality. A comparative analysis reveals that inclusive, community-driven, and digitally adaptive reforms are essential. The paper concludes with scalable policy recommendations to transform education systems and promote equitable literacy development across rural and tribal regions of India.",

    title: "Greenwashing in Corporate Branding", 
    author: "Shamir Hossain Fahim, Egu Florence Chinedum, Disha Agarwal, Adewale Opeoluwa Esther",
    authorAbbrev: "S. H. Fahim, E. F. Chinedum and others",
    abstract: "This study examines the phenomenon of greenwashing in corporate branding and traces its history back to its origins and changes in strategies over time. A review informs the research of the current literature on studies, regulatory laws, and case studies. It identifies the lapses in regulatory loopholes, the lack of standardization, and inconsistencies in enforcement as the main areas that have allowed greenwashing to proliferate. Additionally, it acknowledges an increase in consumer awareness, the shift toward responsible consumption, and the need for independent auditing and standardized environmental reporting to provide transparency and regain trust.",

    title: "Primary Health Care and Foreign Policy: The Overlooked Link in Sustainable Development", 
    author: "Kumar Ankit, Mohammed Amir Saber Hassan, Beza Esubalew Belay and Okeke Eunice Oyinyechiis",
    authorAbbrev: "K. Ankit, Md. A. S. Hassan and others",
    abstract: "This paper examines the underemphasised intersectionality of Primary Health Care (PHC) and foreign policy for sustainable development. It highlights how PHC is situated at the intersection of health SDGs and global health equity but remains underemphasised in foreign policy. Through the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper illustrates how donor-led vertical programmes, conditionality of foreign aid, and geopolitics have a propensity to subvert entire PHC development. It calls for PHC mainstreaming in foreign policy through global health diplomacy, intersectoral coordination, and policy change, emphasising equitable access to PHC boosts social resilience, economic stability, and global security.",
