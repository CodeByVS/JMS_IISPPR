      "This research paper investigates the persistent literacy disparities in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal three of India’s least literate states and examines why national and state-level education policies have failed to bridge the gap. Using Kerala’s literacy model as a benchmark, the study identifies systemic barriers such as teacher shortages, poor school infrastructure, and socio-cultural inequality. A comparative analysis reveals that inclusive, community-driven, and digitally adaptive reforms are essential. The paper concludes with scalable policy recommendations to transform education systems and promote equitable literacy development across rural and tribal regions of India.",

    intro: [
      "Literacy in India displays significant regional imbalances, with Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal continuing to rank below the national average. Bihar, in particular, had the lowest literacy rate of just 61.8% as per the 2011 Census, while Kerala topped the chart at 93.9%, showcasing the stark contrasts in education quality and access. These disparities emphasize that universal education, though a constitutional right, remains inaccessible to many in India.",
      "Raising literacy rates is not merely a statistical endeavor—it directly impacts economic development, public health, gender equality, and social empowerment. Education reforms, therefore, must prioritize quality education for all, particularly in underdeveloped states. Kerala’s education model, widely known as the “Kerala model of literacy,” serves as a benchmark of how sustained public investment, social inclusion, and policy consistency can deliver transformative outcomes.",
      "This paper critically examines the systemic education challenges and policy gaps in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal that have impeded progress. Through comparative analysis with Kerala’s success, it proposes policy recommendations to improve educational infrastructure, boost teacher training, expand digital learning access, and address social barriers such as gender discrimination and language exclusion. The objective is to bridge the literacy gap in India by transitioning from policy rhetoric to tangible educational reform.",

        paragraphs: [
          "All three target states face interrelated systemic challenges that hinder literacy growth. Teacher shortages and quality gaps are a pervasive issue. Bihar and Odisha have struggled to staff remote rural schools with qualified teachers, leading to high pupil-teacher ratios and reliance on under-trained contract instructors. In Bihar, a massive recruitment of para-teachers in the 2000s filled vacant posts but often without adequate training or accountability, resulting in poor learning outcomes. By contrast, Kerala maintains a healthy student–teacher ratio (approximately 27:1, with 1.69 lakh teachers for 46 lakh students) and minimizes non-teaching duties for teachers.",
          "The shortage of trained teachers in Bihar, Odisha, and parts of West Bengal contributes to irregular classes and lower reading proficiency, undermining efforts to raise literacy. Infrastructure deficiencies in schools further exacerbate the problem. Many schools in these states lack basic facilities like libraries, toilets, and electricity, which impedes attendance and learning, especially for girls. In Bihar, as recently as 2016, a shockingly low 0.8% of schools had access to computers, nearly 30% had no library books, and 29.4% lacked any usable toilet.",
          "Odisha and West Bengal fare somewhat better but still have significant gaps in rural areas (for instance, as of 2011 over 39% of West Bengal’s districts had literacy below 70% indicating likely infrastructural and resource deficits in those regions). Poor infrastructure not only hampers quality education but also discourages students from attending – a school without clean water, proper classrooms or digital access cannot retain children in the 21st century. Digital exclusion has emerged as a modern barrier. With education increasingly embracing technology, these states risk falling behind due to limited ICT resources in schools. The digital divide is evident: only 19.6% of schools in Bihar have computers, compared to 99.4% in Kerala.",
          "Rural schools in Odisha’s tribal belt and remote parts of West Bengal similarly lack internet connectivity and devices. This gap became painfully visible during recent periods of remote learning, where students in these states struggled to access online classes. Kerala’s long-standing initiative (introduced in early 2000s) ensured most of its schools are equipped with computers and trained teachers, enabling smoother integration of digital learning. The absence of similar robust digital education programs in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal has left many of their youth digitally illiterate, limiting both their educational and economic opportunities. Socio-cultural barriers also play a major role in perpetuating low literacy. Deep-rooted poverty, gender discrimination, and social norms affect school participation. Bihar’s female literacy was only 51.5% in 2011 nearly 40 percentage points below Kerala’s female literacy reflecting how girls’ education has historically been devalued in parts of society. Early marriage, domestic responsibilities, and safety concerns cause many girls to drop out before secondary level. Marginalized communities, such as scheduled castes and tribes, face additional hurdles. In Odisha’s tribal districts, the mainstream Odia-language curriculum alienated students who speak indigenous languages at home, contributing to high dropout rates. Malkangiri district, for example, has “abysmally low literacy” among its tribal population partly due to this linguistic barrier and the insurgency-related turmoil in the region.",
          "Likewise, in rural West Bengal, children from minority communities or impoverished families may not get necessary support or may engage in child labor to supplement family income. These socio-cultural factors create an environment where illiteracy can persist across generations unless targeted interventions are made.",

        heading: "Urban–Rural Disparities",
        paragraphs: [
          "A pronounced urban–rural divide underlies the literacy disparity in all three states. Urban centers usually enjoy better schools, higher qualified teachers, and more literate populations, whereas rural and remote areas lag far behind. In West Bengal, for instance, the capital city Kolkata boasts an 86.3% literacy rate on par with developed regions, while the rural district of Purulia struggles at roughly 64% literacy. Notably, female literacy in Purulia is barely about 51% illustrating how rural women are the most left behind. A similar contrast appears in Odisha: the literate, urbanized Bhubaneswar area (Khordha district) has over 90% literacy in its cities whereas a remote Adivasi-majority district like Malkangiri has overall literacy below 50% (and female literacy near 38%). Such gaps are also evident within Bihar – Patna, the state capital, tops 87.8% literacy, while districts like Kishanganj remain around 61%, the lowest in the state. These cases illustrate how living in a metro versus a village can determine one’s educational fate. Urban areas benefit from historical concentration of schools (including private and missionary-run institutions), better infrastructure, and greater awareness of education’s benefits. In contrast, many rural hamlets in Bihar or Odisha until recently lacked a secondary school within reachable distance, and villages in flood-prone or hilly areas see teacher absenteeism and irregular schooling. The urban–rural literacy gap also correlates with economic and social divides. Rural communities often have higher poverty rates and depend on child labor in agriculture, reducing school attendance. They are less exposed to the value of formal education if generations have lived without literate members. Additionally, urban elites and middle classes in these states may send children to private English-medium schools, whereas rural poor rely solely on often under-resourced government schools. In Odisha, the rural literacy rate (70.2%) is far lower than urban literacy (85.7%), and rural female literacy is just 60.7%. Such disparities underscore that broad statewide averages mask internal inequities – geography and location critically influence literacy outcomes. Any policy solution must therefore explicitly focus on uplifting rural and underserved areas (like Purulia or Malkangiri) and not just the state as a whole.",

        heading: "Methodology",
        paragraphs: [
          "This research employs a comparative case study approach, examining Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal in parallel to identify common issues and unique contexts affecting literacy. We draw on a mix of quantitative data (census literacy rates, education surveys) and qualitative assessments (policy evaluations, case reports) to build a comprehensive picture. Historical policy documents and program reports from each state were reviewed to trace what interventions were tried and why they fell short. We benchmark these findings against Kerala's experience – analyzing Kerala's educational policies, budgets, and social initiatives over time as a model case. By comparing the target states with Kerala, we isolate which policy differences correspond to divergent literacy outcomes.",
          "We also use case comparisons within states (such as urban vs rural district data) to illustrate internal disparities and the micro-level impacts of policies. The methodology involves critique of past programs using secondary research: academic papers, government reports, and credible news sources provided evidence on implementation gaps and socio-economic factors. For instance, literacy survey data from the National Statistical Office (NSO) and District Information System of Education (DISE) highlight infrastructural and teacher availability issues. Policy impact is evaluated by looking at changes (or stagnation) in literacy rates over time and across demographic groups in each state.",
          "In essence, the study triangulates data from multiple sources – statistical records, policy analysis, and lessons from Kerala – to formulate evidence-based recommendations. This comparative, evaluative method allows us to go beyond anecdotal explanations and identify systemic factors that any successful literacy policy must address. The approach is interdisciplinary, considering educational, economic, and socio-cultural dimensions of literacy, to ensure that the recommended strategies are grounded in both data and contextual realities.",

        heading: "Failed Policies",
        paragraphs: [
          "Historical efforts to improve education in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal have often fallen short due to flawed design or execution. Analyzing these failures is vital to avoid repeating mistakes. National programs like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) – launched in 2001 to universalize elementary education – did increase school enrolment but had varying impacts across states, with the weakest gains in already lagging states. In regions of Bihar and Odisha, SSA led to more schools on paper but not necessarily to effective learning, partly because hiring untrained para-teachers became a quick fix to meet enrollment targets without ensuring quality. Similarly, the National Literacy Mission (including the Saakshar Bharat adult literacy campaign of 2009-2018) made only a dent in adult illiteracy.",
          "Bihar was a focus of Saakshar Bharat, and while it claimed to impart basic literacy to millions of adults, the lack of post-literacy follow-up meant many neo-literates relapsed into illiteracy. The varying success of these central schemes highlights a pattern: one-size-fits-all policies failed to account for local realities like language differences, poverty, or administrative capacity in these states. Looking at state-specific policies, Bihar's attempt at educational reform in the mid-2000s is a telling example. The state undertook a massive drive to recruit over 100,000 teachers on contract (locally called Shiksha Mitras or Niyojit teachers) to fill vacancies in primary schools. While this addressed the numerical shortage (bringing down student-teacher ratios somewhat), it introduced new problems: many recruits lacked proper qualifications or training, were paid low stipends, and had little incentive or accountability.",
          "The result was that classroom instruction quality remained poor – evident from surveys that showed Bihar's children lagging in reading and arithmetic despite attending school. A notorious incident in 2015, where images of mass cheating in Bihar's board examinations went viral, underscored systemic dysfunction – students resorted to unscrupulous means to pass exams, reflecting a failure of foundational teaching and ethical inculcation. This implementation gap – having schools and teachers in name but not in substance – has haunted Bihar's educational initiatives.",
          "In Odisha, one challenge has been delivering education to its diverse tribal populations. The state launched programs like 'Satya Bahama' hostels and bilingual primers to encourage tribal children to attend school, but for years these remained limited in scope. Until recently, curricula did not adequately incorporate tribal languages, causing alienation. The Multilingual Education (MLE) program started in 2007 in Malkangiri is a positive step, teaching young children in their mother tongue and gradually transitioning to Odia and English. However, such innovations took a long time to scale up. Odisha's literacy efforts also suffered from budgetary constraints – education spending as a share of total budget was relatively low in the 1990s and 2000s compared to needs. Frequent natural disasters (cyclones, floods) diverted attention and funds, slowing school infrastructure development in backward districts. The government's 'School & Mass Education' department tried initiatives like recruiting Sikshya Sahayaks (contract teachers) and opening Navodaya residential schools for talented rural students, but uneven monitoring led to variable outcomes. As a result, pockets of the state (notably the eight most backward districts of KBK region – Kalahandi, Bolangir, Koraput, including Malkangiri and Nabarangpur) remained severely educationally deprived.",
          "Odisha's policies often looked good on paper but faltered at the last mile – for example, funds for school construction or girls' scholarships sometimes lapsed due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, leaving targets unmet. West Bengal has a long history of education movements yet also faces its own policy missteps. In the Left Front regime (1977–2011), the state emphasized basic education through programs like the Shishu Shiksha Kendra (SSK) and Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra (MSK) – community-run primary and upper-primary schools in rural areas. While SSKs did expand schooling access in remote villages, they were staffed by para-teachers with minimal training and low salaries, which translated to modest learning outcomes. The transition rates from SSKs to formal high schools were not as high as hoped, indicating that many children, especially girls and those from poor families, did not continue beyond elementary levels.",
          "West Bengal also struggled with educational quality in government schools: political interference in teacher transfers and a lack of English education in earlier decades prompted many families (even lower-income ones) to switch to private schools, leaving public schools under-resourced. Additionally, certain districts with high minority (Muslim) populations, like Murshidabad or Uttar Dinajpur, had very low literacy (around 60%). Policies failed here because they did not address community-specific barriers – e.g. no special drive to educate first-generation learners in these communities or to convince parents of the long-term value of schooling. It wasn't until the 2010s that schemes like Kanyashree Prakalpa (a conditional cash transfer to keep adolescent girls in school) were introduced, and these have shown some success. But prior to that, gender and socio-economic neglect in policy meant many girls married early or many boys dropped out to work, especially in rural West Bengal. Across all three states, a recurring theme in policy failure is the gap between intent and implementation. Budgets were often insufficient – education expenditure per student in these poorer states lagged far behind that in Kerala, where successive governments prioritize funding for schools.",
          "Even when funds were allocated, they sometimes did not reach the school level due to leakages or administrative red tape. Moreover, reforms often did not tackle root causes: for example, providing a school building is futile if social norms prevent girls from attending, or if malnourished children cannot concentrate in class. The past policies in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal often took a siloed approach (focusing on inputs like schools or teachers in isolation) rather than a holistic one. The result was that marginalized groups – rural populations, women, tribal communities – gained literacy at a glacial pace, leaving these states still trailing in basic education even after India as a whole made strides. These lessons from failed or inadequate policies inform the need for a more comprehensive, Kerala-inspired strategy moving forward.",

        paragraphs: [
          "To transform literacy outcomes in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal, an integrated strategy is needed – one that learns from Kerala's successes and tailors them to local realities. Below are key policy recommendations that can bridge the gap from policy to practice:",
          "Strengthen the Teacher Workforce and Training: Invest heavily in recruiting and training qualified teachers, especially in underserved rural and tribal areas. Each state should set up local teacher education institutes and continuous development programs to ensure teachers meet competency standards. Kerala's experience shows the value of a robust teacher–student ratio and freeing teachers from non-academic duties. Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal must similarly professionalize teaching: regularize or replace under-qualified contract teachers with well-trained educators, provide incentives for skilled teachers to serve in remote areas (such as housing or salary uplifts), and enforce accountability for attendance and performance. A cadre of community-based female educators should be developed to reach girls in conservative rural communities, thereby tackling gender disparities in literacy at the grassroots.",
          "Infrastructure and Basic Facilities Upgrade: Launch a mission-mode program to improve school infrastructure to at least minimum norms within 3–5 years. This includes building adequate classrooms, separate functional toilets for girls and boys, clean drinking water facilities, electricity, and libraries in every public school. The contrast with Kerala – where virtually all schools have these basics – is stark; for example, Bihar must urgently address situations where nearly one-third of schools lack toilets or libraries. All three states should earmark dedicated capital funds in their budgets for school infrastructure, possibly leveraging central schemes and public-private partnerships. Monitoring mechanisms (with community oversight) should ensure construction quality and timely completion. Improving infrastructure will particularly help retain girls (who often drop out due to lack of toilets or safety) and create a more conducive learning environment. Each upgraded school can become a hub for literacy in its village, attracting out-of-school children and adult learners for evening classes as well.",
          "Embrace Digital and Distance Education: Bridge the digital divide by providing modern learning tools in government schools. Following Kerala's lead in ICT education, Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal should equip schools with computers, affordable tablets, and internet connectivity. A phased plan can aim for all secondary schools to have computer labs and trained ICT instructors within a few years, and primary schools at least some digital learning device access. Governments could collaborate with initiatives like NDLM (National Digital Literacy Mission) to train both students and teachers in basic digital skills. Additionally, utilize educational broadcasting and mobile technology to reach learners in remote locations – e.g., Odisha could expand radio lessons in tribal languages or West Bengal could use smartphone apps with Bengali educational content for rural youth. By democratizing access to digital resources ensure continuity of education during disruptions (as seen during pandemic lockdowns). Digital inclusion efforts must also be paired with electricity access (solar panels in off-grid schools, for instance) so that technology is reliable. These investments will produce a generation of digitally literate young people, improving both their learning outcomes and employability in the modern economy.",
          "Inclusive and Mother-Tongue Education: Adapt educational delivery to the needs of marginalized communities. A one-size curriculum does not fit a country as diverse as India. Odisha has pioneered multilingual education in places like Malkangiri – teaching tribal children first in their native tongues, then bridging to Odia and English. This model should be expanded and replicated in other tribal-dominated areas of Odisha and West Bengal (which has Santhali, Oraon and other tribal groups), as well as among minority-language communities in Bihar (such as Urdu speakers in certain districts). Teaching children in a familiar language in early grades improves comprehension and prevents them from dropping out in frustration. Alongside, special training for teachers on inclusive education is needed – covering pedagogies for first-generation learners, children with disabilities, and those from socially disadvantaged groups. Kerala's near-universal literacy was achieved not just through formal schooling but also through adult education and alternative learning centers that brought historically excluded groups (like lower castes and women) into the fold of literacy. Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal should reinvigorate adult literacy missions and link them with livelihood skills, focusing on women and older youth who missed formal schooling. Community learning centers in every panchayat (village council) could serve as venues for evening classes, vocational training, and reading rooms, fostering a culture of learning beyond school age.",
          "Community Engagement and Grassroots Campaigns: Borrowing from Kerala's famous mass literacy campaigns, the target states should galvanize a social movement for literacy. Kerala's 1989–90 Total Literacy Campaign, which mobilized thousands of volunteers and community groups, was key to its success. Similar campaigns can be launched in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal with the help of local NGOs, youth clubs, women's self-help groups (e.g. Bihar's Jeevika groups), and Panchayati Raj institutions. These campaigns would involve door-to-door surveys to identify illiterate youth and adults, followed by volunteer-taught classes and reading circles. 'Each one teaches one' initiatives, where literate individuals tutor an illiterate neighbor, can create a ripple effect. Community engagement is also critical for addressing socio-cultural resistance – for example, involving village elders and religious leaders to champion girls' education and dispel fears or superstitions that keep children out of school. By making literacy a collective mission – celebrated with local incentives (like literacy certificates, public recognition for villages that become fully literate) – the states can transform attitudes. The school should be seen as a community asset; forming Village Education Committees that include parents can improve accountability. When communities take ownership of education outcomes, they can help monitor teacher attendance, raise funds for school needs, and ensure every child is enrolled and learning.",
          "Long-Term Financial Planning and Decentralization: A critical lesson from Kerala is the sustained political commitment to education financing and decentralization of administration. The target states must commit to raising their education budgets – for instance, setting a goal to spend a significant percentage of state GDP (or state budget) on education, inching closer to Kerala's per-capita education expenditure. This could involve tough choices like reallocating resources from less impactful areas to schooling, but the returns in human capital will be high. In addition, empowering local governments (district or block level) with funds and decision-making authority for education can improve responsiveness. Kerala's decentralization in the 1990s allowed local bodies to tailor solutions for their schools. Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal can establish district education councils that prepare localized plans: one district might prioritize girls' hostels to address female dropout, while another focuses on recruiting teachers in a particular subject shortage. Transparent budgeting and social audits should be enforced so that money reaches schools – for instance, each school's grant and expenditures should be public information, enabling communities to audit their use. International development funds or corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions can also be tapped for one-time capital surges (like building digital infrastructure or model schools) under state supervision. By planning education investments over a 10-15 year horizon with protected funding streams, these states can avoid the common pitfall of ad-hoc, fluctuating support that derails reforms.",
          "Gender-Sensitive and Equitable Reforms: Finally, all strategies must be overlaid with a focus on gender equity and social inclusion. This means setting specific targets to reduce the male-female literacy gap and literacy gaps for scheduled castes and tribes. Initiatives like West Bengal's Kanyashree (scholarships to keep girls in school) should be expanded and emulated in Bihar and Odisha, alongside efforts to make schools safer and more girl-friendly (e.g. recruiting more female teachers, providing menstrual hygiene facilities). Similarly, provide bridge courses and second-chance schooling for married adolescents or young mothers who want to study later. Educational outreach in hamlets of the poorest communities – Dalits in Bihar, adivasis in Odisha, minority groups in West Bengal – should be intensified via dedicated facilitators. Kerala's success in minimizing social disparities (with literacy rates above 90% for both men and women, and small rural-urban gaps) illustrates that when the most disadvantaged are reached, overall literacy soars. Thus, policies should be regularly evaluated through an equity lens: e.g., are female literacy rates improving year-on-year? Is the gap between a tribal block and the state average closing? Tying funding and administrative rewards to these metrics can incentivize officials to focus on inclusive progress. In sum, making education truly universal will require not just generic improvements but targeted interventions to uplift those historically left behind.",
          "By implementing these multi-pronged recommendations – improved teaching, better infrastructure, digital access, inclusive content, community mobilization, stable funding, and equity focus – Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal can replicate and even build upon Kerala's model. The aim is to convert policy into practice on the ground, so that a child in Malkangiri or Purulia today receives an education as empowering as one in urban Kerala. Each recommendation reinforces the others; together they form a holistic plan to break the cycle of illiteracy.",
        ],
      },
    ],
    conclusion: [
      "If the recommended reforms are pursued with political will and community support, the long-term outcomes could be transformative for Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal. Within a decade, these states can expect a substantial jump in literacy rates – moving from the current ranges (60–76%) closer to the national average and beyond. Bihar, for example, which improved from 47% in 2001 to 64% in 2011 and ~71% by 2017, could accelerate its literacy growth to reach the 80–85% range by the next census through aggressive adult education and improved schooling. Odisha and West Bengal, currently in the 70s, could push into the high 80s, nearing Kerala’s achievements, if they systematically implement the Kerala-style interventions. Crucially, the gender gap in literacy is expected to narrow significantly. With focused female education programs, one would anticipate female literacy in Bihar (around 60% in 2017) to catch up to male literacy (around 80%) over time, emulating Kerala’s near parity (just 4 percentage point difference between sexes).",
      "The urban-rural divides should also diminish: As rural schools get more resources and community engagement, rural literacy rates will rise faster, reducing the disparity. For instance, the gap between Kolkata and districts like Purulia may shrink as rural West Bengal sees new educational investments and campaigns. Beyond the numbers, the qualitative impact will be far-reaching. A literate populace is better equipped to participate in the economy – we can expect improved workforce skills and productivity in these states, attracting more investments and jobs. Literacy is linked to health and social outcomes: newly literate adults (especially women) are more likely to seek healthcare, practice better hygiene, and have smaller, healthier families. Over time, higher literacy can reduce poverty and dependence on manual, unskilled labor as more youth attain higher education and diverse employment. Socially, increased literacy fosters empowerment and democratic participation.",
      "We may see higher voter turnout, more informed civic discourse, and communities better able to demand accountability from officials when people can read news and official information. As one analysis noted, communities with high literacy tend to have greater economic diversification and enhanced social capital meaning people can pursue varied occupations and collectively address their issues more effectively. In Bihar’s context, a literacy boost could help break the feudal and caste-based barriers, as education opens opportunities across social lines. In Odisha’s tribal regions, functional literacy combined with mother-tongue education can preserve cultural identity while integrating tribes into the broader economy and polity on their own terms.",
      "In West Bengal, higher literacy in backward pockets like the Sundarbans or border districts would contribute to human development and reduce regional imbalances. By adopting Kerala’s model of holistic educational development, these states also set themselves on a path toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to education, gender equality, and reduced inequalities. One can project that in the next 15–20 years, with sustained effort, Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal will no longer be tagged as “least literate” but rather as success stories of turnaround. The literacy rate could realistically approach 90% or above by 2040, creating near-universal literacy societies. The expected outcomes are self-reinforcing: as literacy rises, it creates a virtuous cycle – literate parents ensure their children are educated, communities demand better schooling, and educated citizens contribute more to the economy, providing more resources for education. In essence, the reforms would translate policy into practice effectively, making “Education for All” a reality in even the hardest-to-reach corners of these states. The journey will require persistent commitment, but the payoff is a future where all citizens of Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal can read, write, and contribute their talents to the nation’s progress, following in the footsteps of Kerala’s enlightened society.",

    intro: [
      "“In a country where over 90% of working women are in the informal sector, can a law designed for the formal workforce bring real change?” This paradox frames the critical examination of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 — a law that extended maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks and mandated crèche facilities in workplaces with more than 50 employees, in the hope of improving maternal health and women’s labor retention. This article explores the Act’s impact on women’s workforce participation in India between 2014 and 2024, a period marked by policy reform, economic shifts, and a global pandemic. The discussion provides a holistic overview of legislative intent, national labor trends, employer responses, regional disparities, and psychological challenges faced by mothers. Key themes include the mismatch between formal-sector policy and informal-sector reality, the rise in rural women’s workforce participation driven more by economic necessity than legal protection, and the cost burdens faced by employers, especially SMEs. The article is structured around five major sections — beginning with legal and historical background, followed by labor market trends, disparities in implementation, employer and SME reactions, and psychological return-to-work dynamics. These sections together reveal that while the Act is a necessary step toward inclusive labor reform, it remains insufficient in scope and accessibility. The topic holds significance not only for legal and economic scholars but also for policymakers and advocates of gender equity, as it highlights how structural inequality persists despite well-intentioned legislation and underscores the need for broader, more inclusive interventions. It also offers insights into future policy directions for inclusive maternal labor protections.",

        heading: "Background and Literature Review",
        paragraphs: [
          "Historically, India's female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) has been among the lowest globally, stagnating around 23–25% before 2017 despite rapid economic growth and increasing educational attainment among women (World Bank, 2023). This paradox of low participation amidst progress raised significant policy concerns. The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, was introduced as a corrective measure to arrest declining female workforce engagement and improve post-childbirth employment retention. The law extended paid maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks and mandated workplace crèche facilities, aligning with global health recommendations.",
          "However, its reach was limited: it applied only to establishments with more than ten employees and required 80 days of prior work, excluding over 90% of Indian women engaged in informal sectors such as agriculture, domestic work, and unregistered enterprises (ILO, 2021). Academic and policy literature has highlighted both the progressive intent and the practical shortcomings of the amendment. On one hand, it promotes better maternal and child health outcomes in line with WHO guidelines (Strang & Broeks, 2016); on the other, the financial burden placed entirely on employers has raised concerns about unintended hiring biases against women, particularly in childbearing age groups (Dewan & Bhasin, 2020).",
          "Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which often lack formal HR systems and operate on tight margins, are disproportionately affected. Moreover, weak enforcement mechanisms and low awareness levels in rural areas further limit the Act's implementation. These structural gaps call for a more inclusive and sustainable policy approach that extends protection beyond the formal sector and supports both employers and employees in balancing economic and caregiving responsibilities.",

        heading: "Trends in Women's Labor Force Participation (2014–2024)",
        paragraphs: [
          "Data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and the World Bank reveal a complex and uneven trajectory of women's workforce participation in India over the past decade. In 2017–18, India's female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) stood at a modest 23.3%, already one of the lowest globally. This stagnated until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when lockdowns and economic disruptions led to a dramatic decline, pushing FLFPR to a historic low of 16.1% (World Bank, 2021). However, by 2023–24, FLFPR showed a sharp recovery, rising to approximately 42%, driven largely by rural women's increased economic activity.",
          "Despite this promising headline figure, deeper disparities emerge when disaggregated by geography. Rural FLFPR rose from 24.6% in 2017 to a significant 47.6% in 2023–24, while urban FLFPR remained largely stagnant, growing only marginally to 28–30%. This rural surge is attributed less to formal sector employment or maternity-related policies and more to economic necessity, subsistence activities, and government programs such as MGNREGA, livelihood missions, and Self-Help Group (SHG) initiatives. Many rural women engaged in unpaid family labor, piece-rate work, or informal enterprises, which are excluded from most labor protections, including the Maternity Benefit Act.",
          "Urban women, in contrast, face persistent structural barriers: lack of affordable and accessible childcare, rigid job structures, high commuting times, and workplace biases continue to suppress their labor market re-entry. A 2023 NITI Aayog study indicated that nearly 40% of urban women who leave work post-childbirth find it difficult to return within the first two years. Employer hesitancy, particularly in SMEs and private firms, further compounds this issue.",
          "Sectorally, women's participation in agriculture has increased significantly—from 57% in 2017–18 to 64.4% in 2023–24—reflecting growing reliance on informal and unpaid labor rather than formal job growth. Conversely, regular salaried employment among mothers remains low. Only about 11% of mothers with infants held formal, salaried positions, and 48% reportedly exited the workforce within four months of returning from maternity leave, underscoring poor retention and inadequate workplace support.",
          "This pattern reflects the persistent 'motherhood penalty,' where women face slower career growth, wage stagnation, and reduced hiring opportunities post-childbirth. A 2022 study highlighted a 22% drop in interview callbacks for women of childbearing age, particularly in IT and SME sectors. These trends affirm that without universal childcare solutions, flexible work policies, and shared parental leave, India's female workforce will continue to face high attrition and systemic disadvantage after maternity.",

        heading: "Regional and Sectoral Disparities",
        paragraphs: [
          "The impact of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, varies significantly across regions and sectors in India, revealing deep-rooted structural disparities. Southern states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have demonstrated relatively stronger implementation of the Act. These states benefit from higher levels of female literacy, greater institutional capacity, and pre-existing maternal welfare schemes. Tamil Nadu, for instance, has complemented the central Act with state-funded maternal assistance programs such as the Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme, which has improved both awareness and benefit uptake. Effective labor inspection systems and better enforcement mechanisms in these states have further enhanced compliance among employers.",
          "In contrast, northern and eastern states like Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh lag in both awareness and implementation. These regions have higher concentrations of informal employment, weak administrative infrastructure, and limited access to health and welfare programs. Consequently, women working in these areas, particularly in rural settings, are far less likely to receive any maternity-related benefits. Despite the increasing participation of rural women in the labor force post-2020, over 90% remain excluded from the Maternity Benefit Act's provisions due to their employment in unorganized sectors such as agriculture, domestic work, and cottage industries.",
          "The formal-sector bias of the Act results in a significant policy blind spot, denying coverage to the vast majority of India's working women. Sectoral disparities mirror this trend. The organized sector, which employs less than 10% of India's female workforce, is the primary domain where the Act holds legal authority. Within this sector, compliance is more feasible due to better resources and administrative structures. However, small and medium enterprises (SMEs)—even those legally covered—struggle to comply due to financial and logistical constraints.",
          "Faced with the costs of six months of paid leave and crèche facilities, many SMEs choose to limit female hiring or shift toward male-dominated workforces, inadvertently reinforcing gender exclusion. In the unorganized sector, the Act is virtually non-functional, leaving a vast coverage gap and deepening inequalities between formal and informal employment outcomes. To bridge this divide, a hybrid policy approach has been increasingly advocated. Integrating the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) with statutory maternity benefits, providing government subsidies to SMEs, and expanding social safety nets can help improve accessibility and equity. Shared cost responsibilities between the state and employers would ease financial burdens and encourage wider compliance. Without such reforms, the Maternity Benefit Act risks benefiting only a narrow, urban, salaried class, leaving behind the majority of Indian women it was designed to protect.",

        heading: "Employer Responses and Return-to-Work Challenges",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, while progressive in intent, introduced several unintended financial and operational challenges for employers, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which employ a substantial portion of India's workforce. SMEs, typically defined as businesses with fewer than 250 employees, form the backbone of the Indian economy, contributing around 30% to the GDP and generating significant employment, especially for women. However, these businesses often function with limited financial buffers, informal processes, and minimal human resources infrastructure, making full compliance with the Act difficult.",
          "Under the amended law, employers are obligated to provide six months of fully paid maternity leave to eligible women employees, without any state subsidy or cost-sharing arrangement. For SMEs, this translates into a dual burden: direct costs such as continued salary payments during the leave period, and indirect costs associated with hiring and training temporary replacements, disrupted workflows, and reduced productivity. In many cases, businesses also face legal ambiguity or lack guidance on how to implement crèche facilities, further complicating compliance.",
          "In the absence of a government compensation mechanism, many SMEs have turned to workaround strategies. These include outsourcing work temporarily, hiring contract-based staff, reallocating tasks among existing employees, or, more concerningly, avoiding the hiring of women altogether, particularly those in their childbearing years. Surveys and interviews with business owners reveal growing concerns about return-to-work reliability, continuity in projects, and long-term financial sustainability. Some employers have even described the policy as 'well-intentioned but impractical,' particularly for enterprises in the manufacturing and services sectors where staffing continuity is critical.",
          "Despite these concerns, a few progressive SMEs have adopted flexible work arrangements, part-time return options, or partial wage-sharing models to support female employees. However, such practices remain limited and uneven, largely due to low legal literacy, the absence of dedicated HR personnel, and a lack of incentives to promote inclusive hiring. Compared to countries like the United Kingdom or Canada, where the state shares a substantial portion of maternity benefits, India's employer-pays-all model creates a structural disincentive for gender-equitable hiring in the private sector. To ensure that maternity protections do not become a barrier to women's employment, India must rethink its approach—offering financial incentives, tax deductions, or reimbursements for SMEs and creating awareness campaigns on gender-sensitive labor practices. Without addressing these economic realities, the Act risks reinforcing gender gaps in employment rather than closing them.",

        heading: "Psychological Aspects and Return-to-Work Realities",
        paragraphs: [
          "Beyond legal and economic dimensions, maternity involves profound psychological and emotional transitions that significantly influence women's ability to return to work. Pregnancy and the postpartum period bring intense hormonal shifts, physical exhaustion, and identity changes as women adjust to motherhood. These transitions often create psychological vulnerability, particularly in the first six months after childbirth. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 10–15% of new mothers in low- and middle-income countries experience postpartum depression, while anxiety disorders affect an additional 8–10%.",
          "Studies have linked short maternity leave, lack of workplace support, and pressure to return to work early with higher risks of depression, burnout, and poor job retention. Many mothers report symptoms such as fatigue, breast pain, emotional exhaustion, and reduced concentration when they return to work prematurely (Dagher et al., 2014). In India, nearly 30% of new mothers cite domestic responsibilities and inflexible work conditions as reasons for exiting the workforce within a year of childbirth (India Today, 2025). This loss is not just personal—it affects economic productivity and workplace diversity. Psychological barriers like separation anxiety, body image issues, and guilt for not fulfilling perceived maternal or professional roles further complicate re-entry.",
          "Return-to-work outcomes improve significantly when women have access to social support, workplace accommodations, flexible scheduling, and mental health care (Franzoi et al., 2024). India's six-month maternity leave aligns with WHO's exclusive breastfeeding guidelines, offering potential benefits for both maternal and infant health, yet implementation gaps persist. A major challenge remains the 'maternity penalty'—a form of bias where women face reduced opportunities for promotions, raises, or re-employment after childbirth. Studies report a 22% drop in interview callbacks for women in their childbearing years, especially in sectors like IT and SMEs (Das & Ghosh, 2020).",
          "Mental health support is still under-recognized in Indian workplaces, with few employers offering postpartum counseling or reintegration assistance. For maternity policies to truly succeed, organizations must go beyond compliance and foster a culture of empathy, flexibility, and psychological safety. Integrating maternal mental health screening, family-friendly HR policies, and awareness campaigns can help reduce attrition, promote well-being, and create a more equitable work environment. Without addressing these invisible yet impactful psychological barriers, even the most progressive legal reforms risk leaving working mothers behind.",

      {
        heading: "Additional Insights",
        paragraphs: [
          "One of the most significant criticisms of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 is its employer-centric funding model, which places the entire financial burden of paid maternity leave on private businesses, without any state support or subsidy. This model stands in sharp contrast to international best practices. In countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, and several members of the OECD, maternity leave costs are partially or fully subsidized by the government through social insurance schemes, public funds, or payroll contributions. For example, in Canada, maternity and parental benefits are covered under the Employment Insurance (EI) system, ensuring that employers are not disincentivized from hiring women of reproductive age. Similarly, in the UK, employers can recover 92–103% of statutory maternity pay from the government, depending on their size (OECD, 2022).",
          "In India, however, the absence of such cost-sharing mechanisms creates structural disincentives, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which operate on thin margins and often lack the administrative capacity to manage long leave periods. A 2022 All India Manufacturers' Organisation (AIMO) survey found that over 35% of SMEs considered avoiding hiring women in childbearing age groups due to financial and operational concerns related to maternity leave. Integrating existing schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)—which currently offers conditional cash transfers of ₹5,000 for the first live birth—with the statutory maternity benefit framework could help extend support to women in informal sectors and reduce the exclusive burden on employers.",
          "However, PMMVY coverage remains limited; according to NFHS-5 (2019–21), only 28% of eligible women received full maternity benefits, highlighting significant gaps in awareness, access, and implementation. Beyond economic costs, the motherhood penalty continues to disadvantage women professionally. A study by Das & Ghosh (2020) reported a 22% decline in interview callbacks for women in the 25–35 age range, especially in urban service sectors like IT, banking, and education. This bias, both overt and subtle, affects long-term career progression, wage growth, and retention. To overcome these barriers, policy reforms must include government-funded reimbursements, tax incentives for compliant employers, mandatory paternity leave, and investment in subsidized, quality childcare infrastructure. Such measures would not only alleviate the financial burden on businesses but also foster a more gender-equitable labor market by challenging norms that place childcare solely on women.",
        ],
      },
    ],
    conclusion: [
      "While the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 marked a vital step in recognizing and legislating for the needs of working mothers, its practical benefits remain largely confined to a small segment of the workforce—women employed in the formal sector. For the vast majority of Indian women engaged in informal employment, the law has had little to no impact. Moreover, although female workforce participation has shown a notable rise since 2020, especially in rural areas where it reached 47.6% by 2023–24, this increase appears more rooted in economic compulsion and the expansion of informal or subsistence-level employment than in the protective effects of maternity legislation. The pandemic, while disruptive, also pushed many women into low-paying or precarious work to support household incomes. These developments underscore the limited scope of the Act and the urgent need for structural reforms that are both inclusive and sustainable.",
      "India must adopt a multi-pronged strategy that addresses systemic barriers across economic, social, and institutional domains to achieve a broader and more meaningful impact. First, cost-sharing frameworks are essential: offering state-funded maternity leave reimbursements or tax incentives, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), can ease the financial burden and encourage the hiring and retention of women. Second, there is a pressing need to expand affordable and accessible childcare infrastructure, particularly through integrated community-based crèches under the ICDS or in partnership with private and civil society organizations. Third, policy convergence is crucial; maternity benefits should be aligned with schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) and relevant labor codes to ensure that women in informal and unorganized sectors are not left behind. Fourth, promoting flexible work arrangements and shared parental responsibilities, including paternity leave, can reduce the motherhood penalty and support women’s smoother re-entry into the workforce. Finally, robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms must be implemented to track compliance and effectiveness, using data from PLFS, ESIC, or labor inspections.",
      "Ultimately, maternity support must evolve from being a limited legal entitlement to a comprehensive framework that protects, empowers, and uplifts all working women in India, regardless of their sector, geography, or socioeconomic status. Only through such an integrated approach can India bridge the gender gap in workforce participation and foster a more inclusive, equitable labor market.",

    intro: [
      "For generations, the dichotomy between idealism and realism has provided a thesis, an antithesis, and then, at the end, a pragmatic synthesis. Its genesis can be traced back to both traditional Indian philosophers and ancient Greek thinkers, from Chanakya’s eclectic approach towards statism to Shakespeare’s use of the word “Machiavellian” as an adjective. The constant struggle between both schools of thought has formed the foundation for almost every social science, but dominantly that of political science and international relations. The antagonism between “what should be” and “what ought to be” entered the realm of international relations as an academic theoretical practice in the early 20th century. Since then, global politics has never maintained an absolute equilibrium; it has either an inclination towards the left or right, liberal institutionalism or realism. In the year 2024, almost every major democracy witnessed national elections, and the mandate in countries like America, Germany, and even India is signaling a shift towards the rise of the global right. As the Trump administration took charge, every nation is pondering over the question: whether liberal institutionalism is still relevant in this decade or are we back to the old pre-Cold War era realism? From Trump’s tariff and comments on countries like Greenland and Canada to China’s “cheque cum debt” diplomacy in our region to the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars and the recent Indo-Pak crisis, all these events have triggered a need for a curious academic interpretation of the contemporary global situations.",

        paragraphs: [
          "Realism views international interactions, which themselves are colossal and bewilderingly complex, from the perspectives of an intense political struggle for power. The theory perceives individuals and states as primarily selfish and power-seeking. The states are also perceived as unitary actors in the pursuit of their national interest, which unavoidably traps them into an anarchical situation. As such, the Realists view the international system, which itself constitutes a set of rules structured according to some established rules and patterns of international interactions, as anarchical in nature; and consequently, the need for the management of insecurity, which arises out of the anarchical system.",
          "The Realists are known advocates of rationality in decision-making and reliance primarily on balance of power and deterrence to keep the international system intact and as non-threatening as possible. According to Bell, 'Realism is a set of related theories of international relations that emphasizes the role of the state, national interest, and military power in world politics.' Realism, just like any other theory, is a construct of a variety of dispositions by various philosophers, both classical and contemporary. As such, it is widely divided into two major categories, i.e., Classical Realism and a series of contemporary reinterpretations of the theory, the most popular among which is Structural Realism.",
          "However, in 1979, a new impetus was given to the theory by the rise of a popular reinterpretation of Realism termed Structural or Neo-Realism, championed and delineated by Kenneth Waltz. Generally, the neo-realists see the international system structure as the most important unit to study rather than the individual (state), who is labelled to be selfish and power seeking. This structure, the neo-realists argued, is determined by the ordering principle, viz., the absence of overarching authority, and the distribution of capabilities among states.",
          "On the other hand, institutionalism, or neo-liberal constitutionalism, is more of a later and pragmatic manifestation of a broader political theory called liberalism, and the very core of this ideology in IR is cooperation between states, which is achieved through international institutions such as the U.N., QUAD, or SAARC. As one of the oldest political philosophies, liberalism has its roots in the abstract concept of idealism. From John Locke's 'life, liberty, and property' to Kantian's human beings as 'end in itself' to Bentham's utilitarian principle of 'greatest happiness of the greatest number,' liberalism has dominated the philosophical sphere from the century and continues to do so to this very day.",
          "In contrast to realism, which rose as a criticism of liberalism during the late 19th century, liberals propagate few core principles. They argue that human beings are perfectible and primary actors are international actors; relations between states can be based on cooperation rather than confrontation, and liberals also give less importance to military than to socio-economic, environmental, and technological factors. Using the theory of Locke, liberals argue that state interests are both 'self-regarding and other-regarding,' i.e., state interests are dynamic as they keep aligning with the ever-changing human needs. But as time progressed post-WW2, even the most optimistic liberals started becoming skeptical towards human nature, giving rise to neo-liberalism.",

From Kautilya and Sun Tzu in the Eastern world to Thucydides and Machiavelli in the Western world. As remarked by Roger Boesche, 'Kautilya is actually the first great political realist,' and his Arthashastra (4th century BCE) has provided the base for Indian realism with his groundbreaking theories on political realism.",
          "He introduced the Saptanga theory, where he emphasized the culmination off seven factors (prakritis) constituting the power of the state. His Mandala theory identified the relations of a kingdom with its neighbors to identify who is a friend or enemy. He has created the base of the present foreign policies with the four elements (or four circles): Vijishu (king), Ari (the immediate neighbor), Udasina (neutral neighbor), and Madhyama (another neutral neighbor).",
          "Early conceptual foundations were established by thinkers like Immanuel Kant, who argued in his article Perpetual Peace (1795) that a federation of states was required to maintain peace through the rule of law and republican governance (Kant, 1795/2006). Hugo Grotius and Jean-Jacques Rousseau also highlighted the importance of norms and the rule of law in controlling international affairs. However, the advent of legal positivism and the first International organizations, such as the Universal Postal Union (1874) and the International Telegraph Union (1865), which were forerunners of contemporary IOs, marked the formal emergence of the institutionalist tradition in the 19th and early 20th centuries.",
          "A major turning point that led to a boom in international institutional thought was World War I. Woodrow Wilson, the president of the United States, promoted the notion that liberal institutional arrangements could facilitate international cooperation. The League of Nations, created in 1920 by the Treaty of Versailles, was the realization of his vision.",

Article 1(3): Emphasizes international cooperation in solving global issues and promoting human rights. Article 55(c): Advocates for universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.",

    intro: [
      "The globe is currently experiencing a paradigm shift, towards decarbonization of the energy matrix, and hydrogen, as energy vector, has an opportunity in various areas including industrial application processes, power, and transportation. Nevertheless, hydrogen is not a clean fuel by its nature, and its environmental impact would depend radically on its production method. Hydrogen is classified as grey, blue and blue hydrogen today as a short hand of the production pathways, each of which has very different implications on greenhouse gas emissions, resource and ecological trade-offs.",
      "Visualisation of global hydrogen production. Grey hydrogen mainly formed through the steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas but without carbon capture at present has an absolute majority in global production. It has great impact on climate and lifecycle emissions of hydrogen can surpass 1015 kg CO 2 -equivalent of 1 kilogram of hydrogen. Blue hydrogen, by comparison, also includes carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a part of the SMR process with a view to minimizing net emissions, though like SMR itself it still relies on fossil feedstocks and is susceptible to both methane fugitive emissions and varying levels of CO 2 capture effectiveness. The one I commonly hear extolled as the most sustainable is green hydrogen, made by electrolysing water with renewable energy; but it has issues with land use, water requirements, and power intermittency. The variety in this requires a stringent, comparative analysis of the claims of sustainability of each pathway.",
      "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an effective approach that offers an elaborate methodology to measure the environmental effects of the production of hydrogen at its supply chain. In contrast to the energy accounting used in traditional accounting that only covers the operational emissions, LCA backs upstream and downstream exactly that is, beginning with raw materials extraction and ending at the point of delivery. Using ISO 14040/14044 standards, in this study, a cradle-to-gate LCA is used in order to systematically assess and compare the LCA results of grey, blue, and green hydrogen technologies.

It is an improvement on existing LCA databases such as Eco invent v3 and simulation software such as SimaPro and GREET and combines regional differences in power grid emissions, natural gas leakage rates, and CO 2 sequestration performance. Also, it does more than one indicator assessment (e.g. carbon footprint) and provides a multi-dimensional impact profile. These will be using midpoint indicators including Global Warming Potential (GWP), fossil resource depletion, and water stress which allow an overall sustainability assessment of hydrogen pathways. The sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is used to reflect variation of key parameters where sensitivity to efficiency of electrolyser, effectiveness of CCS and renewable energy mix are uncertainties whose conclusions can be made stronger and policy relevant.",

The problem of emitting methane and incomplete decarbonization is significant in such hydrogen as grey and blue. In green hydrogen, the material and energy requirements of the production infrastructure, water and land consumption involve non-trivial factors in the environmental cost. This makes it effective in policy, infrastructure spending and technology development regarding hydrogen in making evidence-based decisions by measuring the impacts and putting them into context of decarbonization targets. Therein lies the only true contribution to a more realistic, more nuanced view on just what hydrogen is in the context of the energy transition, namely: not based in rhetoric but based in a system level analysis of all things.",

      "In contrast, green hydrogen powered by renewables can be an order of magnitude lower: Patel et al. found wind-based electrolysis as low as 0.6 kgCO₂/kg and even solar-based ~2.5 kgCO₂/kg; overall averages for renewables-powered electrolysis are around 2.0 kgCO₂/kg.",
      "Blue hydrogen falls in between: e.g. Patel et al. report ~7.6–9.3 kgCO₂/kg H₂ for natural gas routes with CCS. Under best-case conditions (high CO₂ capture, very low methane leakage), blue H₂ GWP can approach only a few kgCO₂/kg (comparable to the upper end of green H₂).",
      "Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",
      "Important UN SDGs are directly supported by this analysis. Because it encourages clean fuels and applies life-cycle thinking to resource use, assessing low-carbon hydrogen pathways advances SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).",
      "By measuring the GHG emissions of each hydrogen route, it also addresses SDG 13 (Climate Action), guiding decisions that lessen their impact on the climate. By showing that green H₂ production (using renewables) can almost completely eliminate CO₂ emissions per unit of energy, for instance, policies and investments in clean energy infrastructure are encouraged.",
      "The findings will, in general, direct sustainable energy transitions by determining which hydrogen technologies best fulfil the targets of SDGs 7/12/13 and by emphasising the significance of incorporating emissions controls and renewable power into hydrogen strategies.",

      "Climate change is getting worse every year. Environmental harm is more visible now than ever. Following the global agreement of the United Nations, which is known as the Sustainable Development Goals, environmental responsibility has been the guiding metric for many corporations. (United Nations, 2015) Companies are judged by consumers, investors, and the media. This has led to an increase in “green messaging” in brand images and marketing. It has given rise to false or misleading marketing tactics used by many corporations. This phenomenon is known as greenwashing. It is the practice of making a good, service, or policy seem less harmful or more ecologically friendly than it is. As the need to fulfill the global agreement that  (SDGs) increases, the abuse of environmental branding misleads the stakeholders and delays real climate action. This paper studies greenwashing and how branding supports it. It also dives deep into how vague claims hinder trust among consumers. It also explores audits and standards that can help support genuine climate-conscious campaigns and corporations.",

A framework would create expected forms and reduce ambiguity. Consumers will also have power. When consumers demand proof, companies are spurred into taking action to perform better. Media and civil society will need to continue to challenge. Governments have to set up processes.

      "The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines Primary Health Care (PHC) as a 'whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on people’s needs and as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care, and as close as feasible to people’s everyday environment.' This holistic definition situates Primary Health Care (PHC) at the very core of efforts to build a resilient universal health coverage system. The WHO Constitution (1946) recognises health as a fundamental human right and recognises the role of PHC in attaining global health equity. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), under Article 12, obligates states to ensure access to the highest attainable standard of health, including disease prevention and essential services. The idea that everyone should have access to basic health services took centre stage with the Alma-Ata Declaration in 1978, which introduced Primary Health Care (PHC) as the path to achieving “Health for All”. It emphasised fairness, accessibility, and the active role of communities in shaping their own health. The Astana Declaration of 2018 re-established PHC as a central tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. It brought renewed focus to three pillars, not in silos—delivering health services throughout people’s lives, working across different sectors, and empowering individuals and communities to take charge of their health and well-being.",

          "As a model for providing health services and a cross-sectoral facilitator of sustainable development, PHC stands out in relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, inscribing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). PHC is essential to achieving SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, specifically its objectives for Universal Health Coverage (UHC), reducing maternal and infant mortality, preventing and controlling infectious and non-communicable diseases, and ensuring access to essential medical care and prescription medications (SDG 3.b).",
          "Beyond its primary role in achieving SDG 3, the impact of PHC extends to other Sustainable Development Goals as well, given its integrated approach to addressing the societal and environmental determinants of health. By mitigating the burden of out-of-pocket expenditure and arresting the risk of impoverishment due to healthcare costs, PHC contributes significantly to SDG 1 (No Poverty).",

Sustainable improvements in access to PHC are hinged on ensuring donor alignment to national priorities and investment in health system strengthening (i.e., without political conditionalities that limit/undermine the service delivery). Countries should promote “health diplomacy”, which seeks to make cooperative international partnerships rather than political conditionalities for speedy development, while also depoliticising the humanitarian nature of health assistance and support. Policymakers need to work towards protecting health infrastructure from donor countries’ sanctions while also safeguarding workforce development from the effects of foreign sanctions and isolation.",

    abstract: "This paper explores India's use of cultural diplomacy as a tool for global engagement, highlighting its historical roots, institutional frameworks, and contemporary initiatives. It examines how India leverages its rich cultural heritage, diaspora, and soft power assets like Yoga, Bollywood, and Ayurveda to foster international relations and mutual understanding. The study also addresses challenges such as institutional fragmentation and overreliance on select cultural exports, while proposing strategic recommendations for enhancing India's cultural diplomacy efforts. Key successes, including the International Day of Yoga and the WAVES Summit, underscore India's potential as a global cultural leader.",

    intro: [
      "Cultural diplomacy, although rooted in age-long cross-cultural interactions (Grincheva, 2023), is a 21st century’s pillar of soft power in foreign policy and diplomatic relations. It is a branch of foreign policy where countries utilise the uniqueness of their culture to facilitate their diplomatic goals. According to Milton Cummings, cultural diplomacy can be described as the “exchange of ideas, information, art, language and other aspects of culture among nations and peoples in order to foster mutual understanding” (UNESCO, 2023).",
      "Made up of people from diverse religions, languages, cultures and regions, India is not new to the concept of cross-cultural relations. At the national level, India practices interculturalism, encouraging regional diversity and acceptance by promoting pluralism (Manian & Naidu, 2009).  At the global stage, India engages in cultural exchange, sharing its cultural practices with the rest of the world in its diplomatic pursuit. In multilateral forums such as the United Nations, India has emphasised cultural heritage as a universal connector. India’s role in founding the International Solar Alliance aimed at promoting sustainable development in the world’s environment is founded on ancient Indian philosophies like the Prakriti Dharma (harmony with nature) (Mohanapriya & Suriya, 2025). This subtly links India’s past with a vision for the future. Moreover, India's engagement with Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America is increasingly rooted in cultural commonalities. Initiatives like Bharat Ko Janiye (Know India Programme) for youth of Indian origin and cultural festivals (Douw et al., 2024) organised through embassies promote mutual respect and cooperation.",
      "This paper, therefore, reviews India’s use of cultural diplomacy as an important diplomatic approach for positive and peaceful global engagement. In it, the authors examine the historical roots of cultural diplomacy and explore its application within the Indian context, citing select concepts as examples. Furthermore, the paper distils the challenges and successes stemming from India’s diplomatic use of culture as a significant political influence, suggesting recommendations for future initiatives."

          "Since antiquity, India’s engagement with the world has been deeply cultural. As quoted in “India’s Cultural Diplomacy: Present Dynamics, Challenges, and Future Prospects” by Bhanu Pratap, C. Raja Mohan mentions that “India's self-discovery of its rich cultural heritage and its global reach played an important role in shaping its modern nationalism.” In the post-independence scenario, the Indian government has promoted cultural diplomacy through various means; some examples include the Buddhism tourism circuit in the eastern parts of India, as mentioned by Pranay Kumar in “Soft Power and Cultural Diplomacy in the Contemporary World.” According to Shetty and Sehgal in their article “India's Soft Power: Challenges and Opportunities,” India’s cultural diplomacy is exercised through a complex engagement of state and non-state actors. “Red Lantern Analytica (2024)” highlights India's soft power limitations due to institutional fragmentation, overreliance on select cultural exports like Yoga and Bollywood, and lack of evaluation frameworks. “UN (2014)” affirms India’s global cultural influence through the International Day of Yoga, recognized in over 190 countries, marking a major success in soft power diplomacy.",

          "After gaining independence, India's engagement with the world wasn't just political or economic-it was deeply cultural, shaped by the richness of its civilizational heritage. The spirit of the Bhakti movement, with its message of love, equality, and devotion, found a renewed voice in this new era. Saints like Kabir and Meera, who spoke across caste and creed, became quiet ambassadors of India's inclusive ethos, especially through diaspora-led cultural festivals and performances abroad. India also began using its spiritual heritage as a form of soft diplomacy. Sacred relics—especially Buddhist ones—were sent on international tours, creating bridges of faith and friendship. At the same time, India sought to bring home important artifacts from overseas, symbolically reclaiming its past and reaffirming its identity on the world stage.(ICCR 2024)",
          "The Indian diaspora, shaped by histories of colonial-era migration, played a key role in carrying these traditions forward. Across Africa, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, these communities preserved languages, rituals, and festivals, becoming cultural anchors in faraway lands.",
          "Old Buddhist ties with countries like Japan, Thailand, and Sri Lanka were reawakened through initiatives like the revival of Nalanda University and the creation of the Buddhist Circuit—efforts that highlighted shared history and spiritual bonds.(IJHAMS-Bhanu Pratap, 2015)",
          "Even ancient trade routes—once busy with spices, silk, and stories—were reimagined as cultural highways, reminders that India had long been a crossroads not just of commerce but of ideas and philosophies.",
          "As a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, India didn’t just promote political neutrality; it also brought forward values deeply rooted in its civilizational soul—non-violence, pluralism, and solidarity. In doing so, India showed the world that its cultural identity wasn’t a relic of the past, but a living force shaping its place on the global stage. However, the implementation happened over a complex interplay of state and non-state mechanisms, creatively stationed to satiate India’s growing ambitions to portray its cultural image."

          "Through state diplomacy as well as through the very structure of the state itself, the Indian state plays a big role in cultural diplomacy. Being a democracy, rather the world’s largest democracy, naturally adds to it as one of its key advantages, and so do its democratic institutions in better connecting with a shared cohort of values and belief systems (Shetty & Sehgal, 2019). The MEA’s Public Diplomacy Division and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) were established for this very purpose.",
          "The ICCR, with centres in around 37 countries, plays a direct role in augmenting people’s cultural knowledge about India. Alongside it strives to revive and strengthen the cultural ties between India and other countries (Chakraborty, 2019). However, the central task of planning, designing, and implementing public diplomacy programmes in cooperation with relevant government and non-governmental agencies rests with the MEA’s Public Diplomacy Division. The Public Diplomacy Division, which, after its 2014 merger with the External Publicity Division, became the External Publicity and Public Diplomacy Division, is entrusted with four key responsibilities (not limited to). These include the production of audio-visual and print materials portraying the rich cultural spectrum of India, organising outreach activities for creating a more sympathetic image of India and its foreign policy, organising seminars and conferences in collaboration with Indian and foreign universities, think tanks, and chambers of commerce, and hosting delegations from various foreign countries and organisations to India (Laskar, 2019). Besides the institutions, the government has tended to exploit the benefits accrued through its huge diaspora by holding conventions like the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD), utilised the civilisational connect with various Asian countries, and curated tourism outreach initiatives like the Incredible India campaign to leverage its cultural diplomacy.",
          "However, the best soft power deliverables are rarely state-driven; rather, they are mostly exercised through private institutions or individuals. In India’s case, Bollywood, Indian television serials, BCCI, cuisine, classical art, and music have gained significant clout, at times in collaboration with the state, to propagate India’s image abroad. Bollywood movies have long enjoyed unparalleled popularity globally, with audiences hailing not just from South Asia, but also from Central Asia, West Asia, parts of Africa, and Latin America. Added, considerable leverage comes from the excruciating popularity of some Indian celebrities. Next in line, the Indian soap operas have proved themselves as no less. Serials like Balika Vadhu, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, and most recently Anupama have huge digital impressions recorded from several countries. Similarly, the Indian Premier League has been part of the popularity bandwagon since its initiation. In terms of Indian art and music, artists like Pandit Ravi Shankar, Lata Mangeshkar and A.R. Rahman, fashion designers like Manish Malhotra and Sabyasachi, chefs like Vikas Khanna, Sanjeev Kapoor and Vineet Bhatia are recognised worldwide. Together they help exude an increased respect for India, its culture and its diversity (Shetty & Sehgal, 2019)."

          "India's contemporary cultural diplomacy policy rests primarily on its civilizational self-image as a Vishwaguru (mentor to the world) and Vishwabandhu (world friend), positioning itself as an advocate of peace, discussion, and “Vasudhaiva kutumbakam” collective prosperity. Within the Vishwaguru framework, India showcases its ancient epistemological systems—like Yoga, Ayurveda, and Sanskrit—as global public goods. The UN's International Day of Yoga, (UN, 2014) launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 and embraced by the UN the same year, is today observed in more than 190 nations and is often viewed as India's greatest cultural export success. India’s Vishwabandhu identity is backed by its compassionate initiatives like Vaccine Maitri, cultural solidarity with the Global South, and cultivating value-based cooperation through the cultural track of the G20 under India's 2023 Presidency (G20, 2023).",
          "Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, is observed every two years to acknowledge and celebrate the Indian diaspora's contribution to national growth and its vast international reach. The MEA has also launched Initiatives such as the “Bharat Ko Janiye Quiz” which aims to promote cultural identity for second- and third-generation Indian diaspora abroad through interactive sessions and tailored visits to India (MEA, 2024). One of the most successful initiatives is the “Festival of India Abroad”, celebrated in 50+ countries on themes such as Namaste India (Japan) and India by the Nile (Egypt). These government-sponsored events feature Indian dance, food, films, and crafts, underlining bilateral cultural relations (ICCR, 2024).",
          "“Repatriation of heritage” is another high-engagement diplomatic initiative that can be included under the cultural diplomacy of India. Since 2014, India has repatriated more than 300 stolen artefacts from nations like the U.S, U.K, and Australia reflecting a commitment for restoration of its centuries old civilizational pride. (MOC, 2023).",
          "In addition, India has welcomed digital cultural diplomacy. The 2023 G20 Culture Track, with the theme Culture Unites All, focused on heritage protection, cultural diversity, and sustainability, thus incorporating culture into the broader foreign policy domain. The most significant milestone in India's cultural diplomacy this year is the Waves Summit (Waves, 2025), which was launched on 12th June in Mumbai. Organized by Reliance and backed by the government, it established India as a global creative hub. With the involvement of 90+ nations, ₹1,300 crore value deals, and the WAVES Declaration signed by 77 countries, the summit promoted Indian content, crafts, and stories around the world. Initiatives such as WAVES Bazaar and 'Create in India' challenges highlighted India's creative economy and growing soft power."

          "One of the key sources of India’s cultural diplomacy has been its diaspora. Aside from its home country, the Indian diaspora is one of the world's largest populations, with members in practically every country. The Indian diaspora vies with other ethnic groups for political and economic influence in many nations worldwide. In industrial nations including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, India also has a notable footprint. The Indian population mostly serves as a type of soft power in these countries. As per UN Global migration report of 2020, approximately 17.5 million people who identify Indian origin live outside their native country (Singh, 2020). From ancient times to the colonial era and even into the twenty-first century with globalization, this diaspora has evolved across history since the time of the early recorded Indian kingdoms. Motherland has been greatly influenced by the varied ages of Indian migration to several regions of the world.",
          "The Indian diaspora has really been quite engaged in the development of India. It has become more and more clear that India relies on the Indian diaspora for its survival over time. The growth of India has depended much on the philanthropic activities and development of its people living abroad who have sent money back home. Investments made by entrepreneurs from the Indian diaspora have helped to improve the Indian economy. Becoming a major soft power, Indian Diasporas help to define India's links with the nations they live.",
          "Views in North America often mix interest in India's spiritual practices (such as Yoga and Ayurveda) and its growing technology sector, meanwhile tackling concerns about human rights issues and administrative challenges. In this sense, cultural diplomacy often centre on the vast Indian diaspora, therefore improving relations via festivals, traditional arts, and educational initiatives. Bollywood has a small but devoted following. But to solve erratic communication and opposing narratives, it is widely accepted that India's entertainment business and cultural legacy must be used more systematically.",
          "European points of view differ greatly. Countries like the UK, which have historical links, frequently view India from a viewpoint formed by their shared history—sometimes influenced by vestiges of colonialism. Germany and France might start to focus more on the economic potential of contemporary India. Along with classical music, dance, and the range of Indian celebrations, cultural diplomacy often highlights Yoga and Ayurveda.",
          "India's cultural diplomacy in Africa is especially noteworthy, often drawing on historical links and common experiences as countries still evolving. With a large and long-lasting audience, Indian film, often referred to as Bollywood, influences local fashions, music, and social values. Cultural ideas are exchanged greatly valued by the Indian diaspora. Initiatives like International Day of Yoga and promotion of Ayurveda are much appreciated. India's emphasis on improving abilities and fostering South- South cooperation through cultural exchanges helps to build a good image, sometimes seen as a reliable development partner.",
          "Many years of sea trade and the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism have given India a major historical and cultural influence in this region. In the language, architecture, and art of the region, this 'Indic' influence is very strong. Encouraging tourism, building Buddhist circuit schemes, arranging cultural celebrations (like Namaste India), and encouraging academic collaborations help to strengthen these long-running relationships.",
          "Strong underpinnings result from historic ties, Sufi traditions, and the common religious significance (for Indian Muslims doing Hajj/Umrah). Views in the Middle East are largely influenced by the large Indian population working in the Gulf, which helps to raise both economies. Moreover, the Diaspora also has considerable influence on the bilateral relations between the two countries. Hence, it is essential for the Indian Government to ensure the wellbeing of the Diaspora either through appropriate policy measures or by engaging in dialogue and deliberations with the Middle East (Biswas, 2020). Recent initiatives like the BAPS temple in the UAE reflect the growing cultural ties as well as robust financial and strategic partnerships like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).The Indian diaspora is a powerful instrument of India’s soft power, promoting cultural, economic, and diplomatic influence globally. By organizing cultural events, contributing economically, and advocating for India’s interests, the diaspora enhances India’s global image (Hussain & Rather, 2022)."

          "Despite its increasing cultural presence, India's cultural diplomacy is plagued by several structural and strategic issues of which Institutional fragmentation is one such big problem. The ICCR, the Ministry of External Affairs' Public Diplomacy Division and other state initiatives, often operate independently, with little to no coordination between them. This prevents effective cultural diplomacy and results in duplication and watering down of efforts. Another major concern is the lack of strong financial support, which hinders consistency of programmes— compared to more traditionally 'culture-supporting' nations such as China or the UK.",
          "India's cultural diplomacy is also threatened by its overdependence on Yoga, Ayurveda, and Bollywood, restricting resonance in areas such as Latin America, Francophone Africa, and Eastern Europe where local adaptation is poor. Most initiatives are on an ad-hoc basis and event-based, with no formal feedback or evaluation processes. Language issues, inadequate funding, and lack of coordination further undermine long-term influence. ",
          "Still, when done well and consistently, India's cultural diplomacy has proven to be powerful. The International Day of Yoga is the best example for sustained long-term international engagement that emphasizes India's civilizational values. The 2025 WAVES Summit which showed India's capacity to link culture with commerce and innovation by inviting 90+ nations and securing significant economic alliances is also a great example of India's most recent success in its global engagement efforts (Waves, 2025). Digital cultural diplomacy post-pandemic has also played a key role in improving access to India's culture, particularly through online exhibitions and webinars."

What was once a symbolic soft power gesture must now evolve into a coherent, inclusive, and strategic global engagement model. While India’s cultural assets—ranging from Yoga and Ayurveda to cinema, cuisine, and diaspora connections—are globally recognized, their full potential remains underutilized due to fragmented outreach, limited coordination, and inadequate resourcing.",

The Standing Committee on External Affairs has laid a foundation for this transformation, emphasizing the urgent need to restructure the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR)—India’s primary cultural outreach body. A clearly defined mandate, decentralized functioning, and a ₹500 crore budget enhancement are essential first steps to ensure ICCR can respond effectively to global cultural demands.",

A formal coordination committee and joint working groups should drive a unified cultural diplomacy strategy, with shared databases and measurable objectives tailored to regional contexts.",
          "Looking forward, India must adopt continent-specific cultural strategies. Africa would benefit from collaborative art and heritage programs; Latin America could respond to Ayurveda and wellness diplomacy; and East Asia holds promise for cinema and literary outreach. These engagements must be grounded in authenticity and inclusivity, avoiding cultural appropriation and ideological overtones that risk alienating global audiences.",
          "Digital platforms, storytelling tools, and diaspora-led outreach will be crucial to making India’s culture more accessible and engaging. A Yoga Certification Board, as proposed by the Committee, can help preserve the integrity of Indian traditions in global practice. Meanwhile, tourism promotion should follow a country-specific model informed by real-time visitor feedback, supported by expanded overseas tourism offices.",
          "Finally, India must address internal contradictions—such as rising intolerance and gender-based violence—that undermine its external cultural messaging. A credible, values-based diplomacy begins at home.",
          "In sum, India’s future as a global cultural leader depends not just on celebrating its heritage but on strategically investing in, coordinating, and evolving its cultural diplomacy. The next phase must be proactive, inclusive, digitally savvy, and globally adaptive."

    abstract: "This paper explores the challenges of women's empowerment in India, focusing on unpaid labor, caste-gender inequalities, wage gaps, and ineffective policy implementation. It critiques the systemic invisibility of women's work and calls for intersectional policies that address structural barriers. Key recommendations include recognizing unpaid care work, enforcing labor protections, and combating patriarchal resistance to achieve meaningful gender justice.",

    intro: [
      "Women's empowerment in India is deeply intertwined with the complexities of unpaid employment, caste hierarchies, and intersecting social factors. Unpaid domestic and care work remains a central barrier to women's economic empowerment, with Indian women disproportionately burdened by such responsibilities. Being a woman in India often means shouldering a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, navigating patriarchal societal norms, and facing significant barriers to education, employment, and healthcare. This work, largely invisible in economic statistics and undervalued in policy, restricts women’s labor force participation and perpetuates dependency and marginalization. According to the World Bank, women in India spend an average of 5 hours and 35 minutes per day on unpaid care work, compared to 38 minutes per day for men.(Observer Research Foundation. (2022, October 17)) [OBSERVE RESEARCH FOUNDATION,(2022, OCTOBR 17]",
      "Caste and class further compound the issue. Patriarchal norms are more rigid among higher castes, limiting women’s mobility and autonomy, while lower-caste women, despite higher labor force participation, often face double burdens—engaging in both unpaid care and low-paid informal sector work. (Rege, S. (1998)) [REGE, S.(1998)].The lived experience of empowerment is highly variable, shaped by hereditary and localized caste dynamics.(Chopra, D., & Zambelli, E. (2017))[CHOPRA, D.,&ZAMBELLI, E. (2017)] Public policy responses have included affirmative action, reservations, and employment schemes , which offer frameworks for women to claim rights, but implementation gaps persist. The Government of India has initiated various schemes and policies to promote women's empowerment, including the National Policy for Women's Empowerment in 2001. Initiatives like microfinance programs, skill development training, and entrepreneurship support to enhance women's economic independence that will play a significant role in reducing the unpaid work culture of women. Social Empowerment by making efforts to address social issues like education, health, and violence against women, promoting gender equality and social justice which will make women uplift their position in India. Political Empowerment by  Reservation of seats for women in local governance bodies, promoting women's participation in decision-making processes. Studies indicate a positive impact of government initiatives on women's empowerment, but challenges persist, including societal attitudes, lack of awareness, and limited access to resources. Effective implementation and monitoring of policies are crucial to achieving desired outcomes. (Desai, S., & Thakkar, U. (2007)) [DESAI, S.& THAKKAR, U.(2007)]",
      "Ultimately, transforming women’s status requires a holistic approach: recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid work, challenging patriarchal norms, improving education, and ensuring inclusive policy design that addresses both structural and intersectional inequities.

        heading: "Caste and Gender: Interlocked Inequalities ",
        paragraphs: [
          "Caste and gender are not parallel forces of discrimination in India—they are deeply entangled and mutually reinforcing. The lived realities of Dalit, Adivasi, and OBC women are decisively different from those of upper-caste women, not because they are less subject to patriarchy, but because they suffer both simultaneously: the gender-based oppression and the caste-based oppression. These dual burdens often go unreckoned in mainstream feminist discourse, which has historically centered the experiences and priorities of urban, upper-caste women.",
          " In rural and urban settings, caste determines access to education, healthcare, mobility, employment, and security. A Dalit woman, for example, risks sexual assault, systemic police apathy, and social boycott. NCRB statistics register a steady rise in crimes against Dalit women, with conviction rates that remain hair-raisingly low. This disparity reflects a failure not only in judicial mechanisms but also in public policy, which often addresses gender violence in caste-neutral terms—ignoring the specific vulnerabilities of marginalized communities.",
          " Reservation policies in education and employment were designed to uplift marginalized groups, but they frequently fail to consider intra-caste gender disparities. A Dalit man may benefit from such policies while the Dalit woman in the same household remains confined to unpaid domestic labor, often excluded from leadership roles and political participation. Institutions like the National Commission for Women or the Ministry of Women and Child Development seldom incorporate caste-sensitive frameworks into their mandates, leaving the most vulnerable women without adequate support.",
          " 'Savarna feminism'  constitutes a serious bottleneck to all-inclusive policymaking. Even feminist activism that does not listen to Dalit and Adivasi voices tends to function as the instrument through which the existing hierarchy sustains itself in the rhetoric of empowerment. Feminism must truly challenge caste as an apparatus of domination to fulfill its promise of gender justice.",
          " To make feminist policy truly inclusive, an intersectional approach is essential—one that combines gender justice with caste equity. This requires disaggregated data collection, support for Dalit- and Adivasi-led movements, caste- and gender-responsive budgeting, and direct representation of marginalized women in legislative and policymaking spaces. Only by centering the most oppressed can public policy move from symbolic reform to genuine social transformation."

        heading: "Unpaid Labour and the Erasure of Women’s Work ",
        paragraphs: [
          "To be a woman in India is to navigate a complex terrain where empowerment is simultaneously celebrated in rhetoric and denied in everyday realities, particularly through the persistent undervaluation and invisibilisation of women’s labour. To be a woman in India is to carry the economic weight of the nation invisibly — through undervalued informal labour and unpaid care work — while being systematically excluded from recognition in policy and statistical frameworks. At the intersection of feminist political economy and public policy lies the urgent issue of unaccounted work. The India Employment Report 2019 shows that while women’s labour force participation rate (LFPR) has been declining — from 42.7% in 2004–05 to 23.3% in 2017–18 — this statistical drop conceals the persistent and unpaid economic contributions of women, especially in household production, caregiving, and subsistence activities (Mehrotra & Parida, 2019). These forms of work are either excluded from labour statistics or misclassified, undermining both visibility and valuation. The I-PEEL framework critiques this erasure by asserting that unpaid domestic and care work is foundational to capitalist production, yet remains ideologically framed as “non-work,” exempting both the state and the market from redistributive responsibility (I-PEEL, n.d.). Feminist economists like Bina Agarwal have long argued that the binary between ‘productive’ and ‘reproductive’ labour, as imposed by mainstream economics, fails to reflect the material reality of Indian women’s lives. For instance, the Time Use Survey (2019) revealed that Indian women spend nearly 299 minutes per day on unpaid domestic work, compared to only 97 minutes for men. Yet this contribution is absent from national income accounts and marginal in policy discourses.",
          "Moreover, even when women are in the paid workforce, they are overwhelmingly concentrated in informal, insecure, and poorly remunerated jobs. As Dutta (2005) shows, casual work constitutes a key segment of India’s female labour market, where returns to education are negligible, and wage disparities are driven more by occupational segregation than individual characteristics. Dutta’s analysis reveals that while wage inequality among casual workers appeared to decline from 1983 to 1999, this shift masked persistent gendered segmentation and spatial concentration of women in low-value, home-based activities.",
          "Public policy, while increasingly vocal about women’s empowerment, remains fixated on short-term welfare approaches rather than long-term structural transformation. Skill-building programmes, microfinance, and livelihood missions often promote instrumental gains without challenging the underlying systems that devalue women’s time and labour. The India Employment Report notes that rising education among women has not translated into proportionate employment, partly because of the absence of care infrastructure, safe public transport, and formal recognition of women’s labour (Mehrotra & Parida, 2019). A feminist policy framework would prioritise three Rs: recognition of unpaid work in national accounting systems; redistribution of care responsibilities through public provisioning; and representation of women in policy making bodies that shape labour and social welfare norms. To be a woman in India is to be structurally indispensable yet statistically invisible. Remedying this paradox requires rethinking the foundations of work, value, and policy accountability."

        heading: "Wage inequality and Choice of occupation",
        paragraphs: [
          "Women’s empowerment in India represents a complex and multidimensional challenge that has been systematically addressed through public policy initiatives. While notable progress has been achieved in the direction, two significant barriers continue to limit women’s economic advancement in India: wage inequality and restricted occupational choices. The subject has gathered much attention in recent years owing to the structured inequalities rooted in gender, caste, and class which continue to shape women’s work experiences and earnings, despite significant attempts at policy interventions, legal safeguards, and growing awareness. According to World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2024, India’s low rank (129th out of 146 countries) in gender parity score, with women earning 20–30% less than men on average, communicates low female labour-force participation rates and gender disparities in leadership roles, despite the existence of comparable educational backgrounds and experience levels among women. A 2008 report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) identifies that women employment is largely seen in “typically female” job roles (e.g., caregiving, domestic work), which are often unpaid or underpaid. Systemic factors like occupational segregation, underrepresentation in leadership roles, and undervaluation of “feminine” labor perpetuate a cycle of unequal power dynamics and thus, act as key contributors to the issue. Gender wage gap and less occupational choices involve multidimensional reasons ranging from socio-cultural constraints that hinder participation to lack of human capital development among women. Societal expectations and unequal distribution of caregiving and domestic responsibilities limits women’s competence in the economic domain. Gender norms, safety concerns, family responsibilities, and lack of childcare infrastructure push women into low-paying, insecure jobs—primarily in the informal sector. There also exists disparity in professions where women are rarely promoted to leadership roles and when they do enter male-dominated professions, they often encounter a “glass ceiling”. Other social identities like caste, religion, and socio-economic background exacerbate this inequality since Dalit and Adivasi women, in particular, are often relegated to the most exploitative forms of labor with little or no legal protections. These women face severe intersectional discrimination that limits their occupational choices and well-paid jobs. This points to the fact ‘Policies exist, but their implementation lags’. Achieving gender equality is not just a matter of policy announcement but also of its effective implementation. Policies, skilling programs and employment schemes, such as Equal Remuneration Act, Skill India and PMKVY, are steps in the right direction but often fail to address local social barriers or caste-gender intersections."

        heading: "Role of Intersectionality on Labour Market of India",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Indian labour market is deeply influenced by the intersecting dynamics of caste, class, gender, and ethnicity, which shape opportunities and exclusions in complex ways. The concept of intersectionality, first articulated by (Crenshaw (1989)), provides a critical lens to understand how these social categories compound disadvantages in employment contexts. In India, caste and gender play a particularly dominant role in marginalizing large sections of the workforce.(Bazaz and Akram (2021))bring to light how gender and caste intersectionality severely restricts the availability of education and work for lower caste Muslim women, who are subject to double jeopardy in patriarchal and caste-divided frameworks. Upper caste Muslim women, although still circumscribed by patriarchal structures, are comparatively more educationally and occupationally mobile on account of being able to utilise caste capital.In addition, (Jameel et al. (2024)) illustrate that Indian women’s experiences in the workplace are not the same. Dalit and Adivasi women, for instance, confront interlocking disadvantages on grounds of caste, socio-economic status, and gender, resulting in systemic marginalization and restricted career advancement in professional settings. This underlines the limitations of understanding women’s labour market participation from gender alone, calling for an intersectional lens.(Nayak (2020))reinforces this point by demonstrating that in Odisha’s coal mining industry, caste, class, and gender all combine to determine labour segmentation. Marginalized groups, particularly Dalit women, are disproportionately found in the most insecure and informal work, which means that their labour conditions are not merely economically exploitative but also socially stratified. Generally speaking, the Indian labor market is a structure of layers in which social identities construct both privilege and barriers jointly. Intersectionality provides a more nuanced framework to explain these intersecting structures of oppression and demands policy interventions which account for such complexity."

          "The Disconnect Between Policy in Writing and Policy in Action",
          "India has created a great number of public policies and laws that promote women’s empowerment and gender equality. From the very principles laid out in the Constitution where equality is guaranteed [Constitution of India], to the explicitly legislative frameworks, the country's commitment towards gender justice is also indicated through: the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005) (PWDVA, 2005) and; the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act (2013) [POSH Act, 2013]; amendment of the Hindu Succession Act that gives women equal rights to inherit property [HSA, 2005] and the government-led campaigns that aim to change society’s current outlook on improving young girls' welfare (Beti Bachao Beti Padhao) [GoI, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao]. Together, these policies in writing suggest a comprehensive and potentially progressive approach to women’s rights.",
          "Nevertheless, there exists a perennial and critical problem of the gap between the policies themselves (which may have been painstakingly developed) and the way in which they put into practice. There are many factors causing this implementation gap that are intertwined with a bunch of socio-cultural, economic and administrational factors. The major factor is the patriarchal mind-set in different areas of society. After all that said, the primary barrier is that even when there is legal protection, customary gender roles and attitudes can stigmatize women's independent choices and roles.",
          "Nevertheless, a chronic and major challenge remains in the difference between the carefully constructed policies and their implementation. This difference can be explained by a set of multi-layered socio-cultural, economic, and administrative issues. A main challenge is the pervasive patriarchal mindset manifested across the layers of society, and the pervasive and long-standing nature of certain roles and expectations assigned to women in society compounds this issue. This contributes to the possibility of underreporting of gender-based violence; contributes to societal pressure on victims to withdraw complaints; and male-oriented community responses to women asserting their rights. Such culture can essentially undermine even the strongest legal provisions. In addition to these pervasive factors there are very real, systemic administrative challenges that also impede effective implementation; some examples include resource allocation, professional development for those on the front lines, and administrative barriers to accessing knowledge [Gov. Report, 2020]. For instance, while many substantive legal rights exist under statutory law that prohibits domestic violence, when the rights (like access to services, safe shelter, and adequate legal support) are inconvenient, inaccessible and unusable they are useless to provide protection or safe pathways for victims to extricate themselves from a potentially dangerous, sometimes lethal encounter [UN Women Report, 2023]. Likewise, while there is legislation which promotes equal pay for equal work, the large majority of women working in the informal sector, and the subtle, and less subtle, discriminatory practices that exist when it comes to recruitment and career development, wage differentials will persist [Economic Survey, 2024]. The lengthy and complicated judicial process also deters many women from pursuing justice [Legal Aid Review, 2019]. Closing this important gap requires more than a strong enforcement mechanism. It will be necessary to meaningfully address the patriarchal attitude that is pervasive in society, and support women at the community level to understand and exercise their full rights and realize violence-free potential in employment.",

        heading: "Unintended Consequences of Feminist Movements on Women's Rights in India ",
        paragraphs: [
          "Policymaking has long been accompanied with a predictable and unyielding reality, an adage as old as time, yet never untrue: resistance to change is inevitable. Men specifically have resisted policies that give women the autonomy and freedom to do as they please, unfortunately some women too. Only recently were women in Saudi Arabia allowed to drive (Specia, 2019), but this change has seen a rise in resistance to feminist laws - to date, activists for womens’ right to drive are still being jailed, even though this law was implemented in 2019. There are numerous other examples of resistance to policies that advocate for the freedom of women - for a country that is culturally rich and extremely patriarchal, India is no exception to this resistance. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, it is ironic that laws created to give women the liberty and freedom they so desire have been the catalyst for violence towards women and in some cases, even leading to death. In 2022, Genocide Watch declared a female genocide emergency in India (Kadiwa, 2023). In early 2023, Crime Record Bureau estimated that One Indian woman is killed every hour over patriarchal disputes (Al-Jazeera, 2023) and the arrest of female activists is not uncommon in India. When a government indirectly discourages a certain movement by imprisoning those who advocate for it, by repressing and silencing individuals, it brings to question whether the government truly cares for these specific rights and consequently exposes the hypocrisy and contradictions of that government. The arrests of Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal (International, 2020), female activists who were fighting against restrictions on female students in 2020 raises questions on the message that is trying to be delivered. Feminism has been considered threatening and undesirable by many patriarchal and oppressive regimes (Guardian, 2019), possibly because women have always been seen as property rather than people with individual desires and autonomy. Another reason why feminism is considered a threat is misconceptions on what feminism actually is, a majority of people ignorantly mistake feminism to be an agenda against men, when in reality feminism seeks only to establish women as independent entities, unshackled from society's expectations. It is also important to remember that in most cultural setups, men are considered powerful and invincible and feminism threatens this notion (Mitengu, 2019). It is truly unfortunate that the enactment of some feminist policies has resulted in violence against women, but it is the bravery of those who have suffered and died for this cause that make this movement and the policies that support it, all the more important."

    conclusion: [
      "The future of women's empowerment in India depends not only on progressive legislation but on how deeply public institutions, civil society, and local communities internalize and act upon feminist values. A transformative agenda requires persistent structural reform, participatory governance, and culturally grounded feminist policy that ensures no woman — regardless of caste, class, or occupation — is left behind."

  intro: [
    "Cultural diplomacy has become an essential tool in India’s foreign policy, positioning the nation as a civilizational power through the promotion of its traditions, symbols, and soft power resources. This paper examines the interplay between symbolism and diplomacy in India’s global affairs strategy.",
    "From promoting yoga on a global scale to celebrating Bollywood’s global fandom, India has leveraged culture to shape perceptions and strengthen transnational ties. Cultural events, festivals, and digital campaigns have reinforced India's soft image while building long-term diplomatic goodwill.",
    "This study explores how India uses historical figures, visual identity, spiritual heritage, and popular culture as instruments of engagement and persuasion in the international arena."

      heading: "India's Soft Power: Concepts and Foundations",
      paragraphs: [
        "Soft power, as defined by Joseph Nye, refers to a country’s ability to attract and co-opt rather than coerce. India’s appeal lies in its diverse cultural practices, democratic values, and spiritual legacy. These assets form the foundation of its cultural diplomacy efforts.",
        "Indian foreign policy increasingly integrates soft power through platforms like the International Day of Yoga, cultural diplomacy programs through Indian missions abroad, and diaspora festivals."

      heading: "Scripts, Symbols, and National Identity",
      paragraphs: [
        "Cultural scripts such as 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family), Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence, and spiritual traditions such as yoga and Ayurveda serve as central narratives of India’s cultural diplomacy.",
        "These symbols are not only part of India's internal national identity but are used to shape how India is perceived on the global stage. The Government actively promotes these symbols through diplomatic messaging, events, and even architecture."

      heading: "Bollywood and Popular Media as Diplomatic Tools",
      paragraphs: [
        "Indian cinema plays a powerful role in soft power diplomacy. Bollywood, with its global popularity, exports narratives about Indian culture, family values, and aesthetics that resonate across continents.",
        "Film festivals, cross-cultural collaborations, and streaming platforms extend Bollywood's diplomatic reach, particularly in countries with large Indian diaspora populations or cultural similarities."

      heading: "Diaspora and Transnational Linkages",
      paragraphs: [
        "India's global diaspora—among the world’s largest—plays an active role in extending the nation’s soft power. Cultural events, language programs, and heritage preservation initiatives are often driven by diaspora communities.",
        "Indian embassies collaborate with diaspora organizations to promote cultural diplomacy through dance, cuisine, classical arts, and even contemporary innovations in technology and business."

    {
      heading: "Limits, Critiques, and the Need for Coherence",
      paragraphs: [
        "Despite its symbolic power, India’s soft diplomacy faces critiques—particularly when domestic social tensions (e.g., religious intolerance or press restrictions) contradict the democratic image projected abroad.",
        "A coherent cultural diplomacy strategy must align internal governance with external messaging to ensure credibility. Otherwise, soft power risks becoming symbolic rather than substantive."
      ]
    }
  ],
  conclusion: [
    "India’s use of cultural diplomacy illustrates the power of storytelling, symbolism, and heritage in shaping global influence. The country's strategic deployment of yoga, Bollywood, Gandhian ideals, and diaspora networks has positioned it as a civilizational soft power.",
    "However, sustaining this influence requires aligning domestic realities with external messaging, ensuring authenticity, consistency, and inclusive representation in all its diplomatic efforts."
