    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Our Commitment to Ethical Publishing</h3>
    <p>
      At Law, Diplomacy, Tech & Public Policy Review, we uphold the highest standards of academic integrity, transparency, and ethical publishing. As a platform dedicated to nurturing undergraduate, postgraduate, and early-career researchers, we recognize our responsibility to foster a safe, inclusive, and credible academic space.<br/>
      We strictly oppose all forms of unethical academic practices, including predatory publishing, plagiarism, and exploitation of student researchers.<br/>
      These guidelines apply to all authors, editors, peer reviewers, and contributors associated with LDTPPR.
    </p>

    <h2 className="mt-8">1. Author Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul className="mb-4">
      <li><b>✔ Originality and Plagiarism:</b> Authors must ensure their submissions are original and properly cite all sources. Plagiarism, including self-plagiarism beyond acceptable academic limits, is strictly prohibited. All submissions will undergo plagiarism checks prior to peer review.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Accurate Representation:</b> Research findings must be reported honestly, without fabrication, falsification, or data manipulation. Authors are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all information, citations, and data presented.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Authorship and Acknowledgment:</b> Only individuals who have made significant scholarly contributions should be listed as authors. Others who contributed indirectly (e.g., technical support, mentorship) should be acknowledged appropriately. Ghostwriting or honorary authorship is prohibited.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Multiple Submissions:</b> Authors must not submit the same work to multiple journals simultaneously.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest:</b> Authors must disclose any financial, institutional, or personal conflicts of interest that could influence their work.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Respect for Ethical Research Standards:</b> Research involving human participants, data privacy, or sensitive topics must comply with ethical standards, including necessary institutional approvals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Editorial Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul className="mb-4">
      <li><b>✔ Fair and Transparent Review Process:</b> All submissions undergo double-blind peer review to ensure fairness and objectivity. Editorial decisions are based solely on academic merit, relevance, and originality—without bias related to authors' background, institutional affiliation, or career stage.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Support for Emerging Researchers:</b> Editors will provide constructive, developmental feedback, especially to UG, PG, and early-career authors. We commit to mentorship-driven editorial processes that help new scholars improve their work.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Confidentiality:</b> Manuscript content and author identities will be kept strictly confidential during the review process.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Editorial Integrity:</b> Editors will recuse themselves from handling submissions where conflicts of interest exist. We reject unethical influence from sponsors, institutions, or individuals over editorial decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Peer Reviewer Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul className="mb-4">
      <li><b>✔ Confidentiality and Respect:</b> Reviewers must treat all manuscripts as confidential documents and avoid sharing or using content for personal gain.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Objective, Constructive Feedback:</b> Reviews should be fair, unbiased, and focused on academic merit—not personal opinions or identity-based judgments. Reviewers should provide actionable feedback that helps authors improve their work, especially supporting student researchers.</li>
      <li><b>✔ Conflict of Interest Disclosure:</b> Reviewers must decline assignments where conflicts of interest exist (e.g., personal, institutional, or competitive conflicts).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Anti-Predatory Publishing Commitment</h2>
